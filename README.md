# Lab 7 - FCA 2024

* Write your program in a seperate folder:  `ex1`, `ex2`, `ex3`
* Inside each folder, your code should have a file named `main.c`
* And inside each folder, you have to copy the file `Makefile`

--------------------------------------------
## Exercise 1: Recursive Factorial Function

Write a C program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer using a recursive function.

Input

A single non-negative integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 12).

Output

The factorial of n.

Sample Input


5

Sample Output

120


--------------------------------------------
## Exercise 2: Array Rotation

Write a C program that rotates the elements of an array to the right by k positions. The array and the number of rotations k should be input by the user.

Input

First line: An integer n representing the number of elements in the array (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

Second line: n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Third line: An integer k representing the number of rotations (0 ≤ k ≤ n).

Output

The rotated array, with elements separated by spaces.

Sample Input

5

1 2 3 4 5

2

Sample Output

4 5 1 2 3

--------------------------------------------
## Exercise 3: Bubble Sort with Function

Write a C program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. Implement the sorting logic inside a separate function.

Input

An integer n representing the number of elements in the array (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

n space-separated integers.

Output

The sorted array, with elements separated by spaces.

Sample Input

6

64 34 25 12 22 11

Sample Output

11 12 22 25 34 64
